# Twitter Handle
This Project has been deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)  
It is a Twitter bot for changing my handle on every birthday according to my age.  
Tweepy has been used for accessing the Twitter API.  
If anyone wants to use it for themself they have to first apply Twiiter developer account and then deploy it.  
As you can see there are some variable like consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret.  
These variable will be available in Twitter developer account and then you can set these on when deploying for security.
